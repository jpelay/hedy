Hoặc nhấn vào nút màu xanh trong khối mã ví dụ, và mã sẽ được gõ tự động cho bạn!\nHãy thử mã của bạn bằng cách sử dụng nút 'Chạy mã' màu xanh dưới trường lập trình.\nBạn có thể in ra màn hình văn bản bằng cách sử dụng lệnh `{print}`.\n"

The minus also works fine, it is `5 - 5`.\n\n The times is a bit different, because there is no times symbol on your keyboard. Just search, there really isn't!\n That is why we multiply with the asterisk above 8: `5 * 5`. Read that as \"5 times 5\" that helps you remember it best.\n"

But `{if}`, `{else}` and `{repeat}` have changed!\nYou can now execute groups of code together, but you will have to *indent* the code.\nThat means putting four spaces at the beginning of the line. You will also have to indent when you just want to create a block of one line.\n"
                example_code: "This is how the `{repeat}` command works now:\n```\n{repeat} 5 {times}\n    {print} 'Hello everyone'\n    {print} 'This is all repeated 5 times'\n```\nThis is how the `{if}` and `{else}` command work now:\n\n```\nname {is} {ask} 'What is your name?'\n{if} name {is} Hedy\n    {print} 'Welcome Hedy'\n    {print} 'You can play on your computer!'\n{else}\n    {print} 'INTRUDER!'\n    {print} 'You cannot use this computer!'\n```\n"

If you use `{and}`, both statements, left and right of the `{and}` need to be true. We can also use `{or}`. Then only one statement needs to be correct."

                story_text: "We are going to learn more new items. You might know them already from mathematics, the `<` and `>`.\nThe `<` checks if the first number is smaller than the second, for example age `<` 12 checks if age is smaller than 12.\nIf you want to check if the first number is smaller or equal to the second, you can use `<=`, for example age `<=` 11.\nThe `>` checks if the first number is bigger than the second, for example points `>` 10 checks if points is larger than 10.\nIf you want to check if the first number is bigger or equal to the second, you can use `>=`, for example points `>=` 11.\nYou use these comparisons in an `{if}`, like this:\n"

Trong ví dụ này, chúng tôi tạo ra một biến có tên là \"name\" và một biến có tên là \"age\". Bạn có thể sử dụng từ \"name\" bất kỳ nơi nào trong mã của bạn và nó sẽ được thay thế bằng \"Hedy\", như thế này:\nNhư vậy, bạn không cần sử dụng lệnh `{echo}` nữa!\n"
                example_code: "```\nname {is} Hedy\nage {is} 15\n{print} name is age years old\n```\n"

                start_code: "{print} 'Hello world'"
                story_text: "In level 4 `{ask}` and `{print}` have changed.\n\nYou must put text that you want to print between quotation marks.\n\nThis is useful, because now you can print all the words you want. Also the words you used to store something with `{is}`.\n\nMost programming languages also use quotation marks when printing, so we are also getting a step closer to real programming!\n"
                example_code: "```\n{print} 'You need to use quotation marks from now on!'\nanswer {is} {ask} 'What do we need to use from now on?'\n{print} 'We need to use ' answer\n```\n"

                story_text: "In this level you can not only use multiple lines with `{if}` and `{repeat}`, but you can also put them together!\nIn the example you see an `{if}` command within a `{repeat}` command. It is also allowed the other way around, and an `{if}` is also allowed in an `{if}` and a `{repeat}` in a `{repeat}`.\nGive it a try!\n"
                example_code: "```\n{repeat} 3 {times}\n    food = {ask} 'What do you want?'\n    {if} food {is} pizza\n        {print} 'nice!'\n    {else}\n        {print} 'pizza is better'\n```\n"

                story_text: "In this level we learn a new code called `{for}`. With `{for}` you can make a list and use all elements.\n`{for}` creates a block, like `{repeat}` and `{if}` so all lines in the block need to start with spaces."

                story_text: "`{print}` works just the same but we add a new form of the `{for}`. You can now write `{for} counter {in} {range} 1 {to} 5` instead of `{repeat} 5 {times}` and use `counter` in your program.\nTry it out to see what happens! Remember to use indentations after the `{for}` and `{if}` statements (That means starting a sentence with four spaces)."
            12:
                start_code: "{print} 'decimal numbers now need to use a dot'\n{print} 2.5 + 2.5"
                story_text: "**Decimal numbers**\nSo far, Hedy did not allow for decimal numbers like 1.5, but now we do allow that. Note that computers use the `.` for decimal numbers."

                story_text: "We are going to learn a new loop, the `{while}` loop! We continue the loop as long as the statement is true.\nSo don't forget to change the value in the loop.\n\nIn the example code, we continue until a correct answer has been given.\nIf the correct answer is never given, the loop never ends!"
                example_code: "```\nanswer = 0\n{while} answer != 25\n    answer = {ask} 'What is 5 times 5?'\n{print} 'A correct answer has been given'\n```\n"

Every time that we need an indentation, we need `:` at the line before the indentation.\n\nIn this level you can also use a new command: `{elif}`. `{elif}` is short for {else} {if} and you need it when you want to make 3 (or more!) options.\nCheck it out!"
